The async operations are put into an event queue. Hence, the bar() function in the stack runs first. Then B is wrong. If we get the API of the second fetch first, the 'gotUsers' variable is false, then we will get into an infinite loop, which will never prints 'foo' even if we then get the API of the first fetch. Hence, C is wrong and A is correct.
